    And thankfully, with your time and efforts, the remote database appears to
    have already been migrated. Congratulations!


    However, we need a bit more. The configuration of this device is not
    compatible with the remote database. We will need to fetch the remote
    database again. Should we fetch from the remote again now?


    ___Note: We cannot synchronise until the configuration has been changed and
    the database has been fetched again.___

    metadata and difference.___
  msgInitialSetup: >-

    Please keep in mind that every dialogue content can be copied to the

    Obsidian. You can also translate it into your language using a translation
    tool.


    First, do you have **Setup URI**?


    Note: If you do not know what it is, please refer to the
    [documentation](${URI_DOC}).
  msgRecommendSetupUri: >-
    We strongly recommend that you generate a set-up URI and use it.

    If you do not have knowledge about it, please refer to the
    [documentation](${URI_DOC}) (Sorry again, but it is important).


    How do you want to set it up manually?
  msgSinceV02321: >-
    Since v0.23.21, the self-hosted LiveSync has changed the default behaviour
    and database structure. The following changes have been made:


    1. **Case sensitivity of filenames**
       The handling of filenames is now case-insensitive. This is a beneficial change for most platforms, other than Linux and iOS, which do not manage filename case sensitivity effectively.
       (On These, a warning will be displayed for files with the same name but different cases).

    2. **Revision handling of the chunks**
       Chunks are immutable, which allows their revisions to be fixed. This change will enhance the performance of file saving.

    ___However, to enable either of these changes, both remote and local
    databases need to be rebuilt. This process takes a few minutes, and we
    recommend doing it when you have ample time.___


    - If you wish to maintain the previous behaviour, you can skip this process
    by using `${KEEP}`.

    - If you do not have enough time, please choose `${DISMISS}`. You will be
    prompted again later.

    - If you have rebuilt the database on another device, please select
    `${DISMISS}` and try synchronizing again. Since a difference has been
    detected, you will be prompted again.

    WARNING: This feature is a Work In Progress, so please keep in mind the
    following:

    - Append only architecture. A rebuild is required to shrink the storage.

    - A bit fragile.

    - When first syncing, all history will be transferred from the remote. Be
    mindful of data caps and slow speeds.

    - Only differences are synced live.


    If you run into any issues, or have ideas about this feature, please create
    a issue on GitHub.

    I appreciate you for your great dedication.

    description: >2-
       This replicator allows us to synchronise our vault with other devices
      using a peer-to-peer connection. We can        use this to synchronise our
      vault with our other devices without using a cloud service.

      This replicator is based on Trystero. It also uses a signaling server to
      establish a connection between devices. The signaling server is used to
      exchange connection information between devices. It does (or,should) not
      know or store any of our data.


      The signaling server can be hosted by anyone. This is just a Nostr relay.
      For the sake of simplicity and checking the behaviour of the replicator,
      an instance of the signaling server is hosted by vrtmrz. You can use the
      experimental server provided by vrtmrz, or you can use any other server.


      By the way, even if the signaling server does not store our data, it can
      see the connection information of some of our devices. Please be aware of
      this. Also, be cautious when using the server provided by someone else.

        > **Low Traffic**, **High CPU**, **Low Risk**

        > This option first creates a local database using existing local files
        before fetching data from the remote source.

        > If matching files exist both locally and remotely, only the
        differences between them will be transferred.

        > However, files present in both locations will initially be handled as
        conflicted files. They will be resolved automatically if they are not
        actually conflicted, but this process may take time.

        > This is generally the safest method, minimizing data loss risk.

        > ## %{RedFlag.Fetch.Method.FetchSmoother}.

        > **Low Traffic**, **Moderate CPU**, **Low to Moderate Risk** (depending
        operation)

        > This option first creates chunks from local files for the database,
        then fetches data. Consequently, only chunks missing locally are
        transferred. However, all metadata is taken from the remote source.

        > Local files are then compared against this metadata at launch. The
        content considered newer will overwrite the older one (by modified
        time). This outcome is then synchronised back to the remote database.

        > This is generally safe if local files are genuinely the latest
        timestamp. However, it can cause problems if a file has a newer
        timestamp but older content (like the initial `welcome.md`).

        > This uses less CPU and faster than
        "%{RedFlag.Fetch.Method.FetchSafer}", but it may lead to data loss if
        not used carefully.

        > ## %{RedFlag.Fetch.Method.FetchTraditional}.

        > **High Traffic**, **Low CPU**, **Low to Moderate Risk** (depending
        operation)

        > All things will be fetched from the remote.

        > Similar to the %{RedFlag.Fetch.Method.FetchSmoother}, but all chunks
        are fetched from the remote source.

        > This is the most traditional way to fetch, typically consuming the
        most network traffic and time. It also carries a similar risk of
        overwriting remote files to the '%{RedFlag.Fetch.Method.FetchSmoother}'
        option.

        > However, it is often considered the most stable method because it is
        the longest-established and most straightforward approach.

          Remote database is locked. This is due to a rebuild on one of the
          terminals.

          The device is therefore asked to withhold the connection to avoid
          database corruption.


          There are three options that we can do:


          - %{Replicator.Dialogue.Locked.Action.Fetch}
            The most preferred and reliable way. This will dispose the local database once, and fetch all from the remote database again, In most case, we can perform this safely. However, it takes some time and should be done in stable network.
          - %{Replicator.Dialogue.Locked.Action.Unlock}
            This method can only be used if we are already reliably synchronised by other replication methods. This does not simply mean that we have the same files. If you are not sure, you should avoid it.
          - %{Replicator.Dialogue.Locked.Action.Dismiss}
              This will cancel the operation. And we will asked again on next request.

        Configure this device as a new client. After applying, synchronise from the remote server.
      - Apply and Merge
        Configure on a device that already has the file. It processes the local files and transfers the differences. Conflicts may arise.
      - Apply and Rebuild
        Rebuild the remote using local files. This is typically done if the server becomes corrupted or we wish to start from scratch.
        Other devices will be locked and required to re-fetch.
